# Code book for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The data come from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

A full description can be found:

The script combines data from the following files into one set:

  -X_train.txt: Training set.
  
  -y_train.txt: Training labels.
  
  -X_test.txt: Test set.
  
  -y_test.txt: Test labels.
  
  -subject_train.txt
  
  -subject_test.txt
 
 # Variables
 
   - subject. Subject identifier. From 1 to 30
   - activity. Activity identifier. & possible values
  
 The measurements are normalised and bounded within [-1,1]
